# MNIST_NN
Neural Network (1 hidden layer) to recognize MNIST handwritten digits

The file takes the handwritten digits data from MNIST and use neural network to train a classifier to recognize the digits.
The NN has one hidden layer, having 100 neuron (plus a bias) to filter the information. It runs through 1000 loops to train the classifier, and the result for applying on testing data is 95% accuracy.
